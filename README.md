# Tasks_Sparks-Foundation
Performed Data Science & Machine Learning tasks given by Sparks Foundation.
Here we firstly imported important libraries used in our project then we imported the dataset from the CSV file provided, then we sorted the dataset and scatter plot it and then we split the data in dependant and independant feature.
Then we build a Linear Regression Model and predict the scores of a student if he studies for 9.25 hrs in a day.
